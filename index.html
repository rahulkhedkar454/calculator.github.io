            <h3 class="section-title">what is calculator?</h3>
            <p>
              A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on
              numbers. Basic calculators can do only addition, subtraction,
              multiplication and division mathematical calculations.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, more sophisticated calculators can handle exponential
              operations, square roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions and
              hyperbolic functions. Internally, some calculators perform all
              these functions by repeated addition processes.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="section main-article-chapter">
            <h3 class="section-title">the evolution of the calculator</h3>
            <p>
              Most calculators these days require electricity to operate or are
              battery-powered calculators. Calculators work by performing
              programmed functions based on numerical inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before the electronic calculator (circa 1970), a more primitive
              calculator, the slide rule, was commonly used. It consisted of a
              slat of wood called the slide that could be moved in and out of a
              reinforced pair of slats. Both the slide and the outer pair of
              slats had calibrated numerical scales.
            </p>
            <p>
              A movable, transparent sleeve called the cursor was used to align
              numerals on the scales. The slide rule did not require any power
              source, but its precision was limited, and it was necessary to
              climb a learning curve to become proficient with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most primitive calculators, the abacus, is still used
              in some regions of the Far East. The abacus acts as an adding
              machine that uses groups of beads to denote numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like the slide rule, the abacus requires no source of power. The
              beads are positioned in several parallel rows and can be moved up
              and down to denote arithmetic operations. It is said that a
              skilled abacus user can do some calculations just as fast as a
              person equipped with a battery-powered calculator.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="section main-article-chapter">
            <h3 class="section-title">modern calculators</h3>
            <p>
              As calculators became more advanced during the 1970s, they were
              able to make problem-solving computations involving variables
              (unknowns). These were the first personal computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, calculators have digital versions that can be
              downloaded or come with most smartphone and personal computer
              operating systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today's personal computers can still perform such operations, and
              most are provided with a virtual calculator program that looks, on
              screen, like a hand-held calculator. The buttons are actuated by
              pointing and clicking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Theoretically, a modern computer is a calculator that works with
              binary numbers and has a much larger memory. But in the practical
              sense, a computer is far more than a mere calculator because of
              the wide variety of noncomputational tasks it can perform.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="section main-article-chapter">
            <h3 class="section-title">types of calculators</h3>
            <h4 class="section-subtitle">1) basic calculators</h4>
            <p>
              The most basic calculator is the four-function calculator, which
              can perform basic arithmetic such as addition, subtraction,
              multiplication and division.
            </p>
            <p>
              These are sometimes called pocket calculators or hand-held
              electronic calculators because they are small enough to fit in a
              shirt pocket. They are also the least expensive calculator,
              costing around $5 or less.
            </p>
            <p>
              Four-function calculators usually have a +, -, x and / sign to
              denote the operations and can produce decimal numbers. Some also
              have a % button, which is used to calculate percentages.
            </p>
            <h4 class="section-subtitle">2) scientific Calculators</h4>
            <p>
              As its name suggests, the scientific calculator is designed for
              performing scientific calculations.
            </p>
            <p>
              This type of calculator usually has more buttons than a standard
              calculator, as it needs to be able to perform trigonometric
              functions, logarithms, sine/cosine and exponential operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scientific calculator also usually has a larger display to
              view long equations and see more digits at a time.
            </p>
            <h4 class="section-subtitle">3) graphing calculators</h4>
            <p>
              The next type of calculator is the graphing calculator. The
              graphing calculator is similar to the scientific calculator in
              that it can perform many of the same operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the graphing calculator also can graph equations, for
              example, with more advanced mathematics like trigonometry, on a
              coordinate plane. This is a valuable tool for visual learners or
              those studying mathematics that requires a lot of graphing, such
              as calculus.
            </p>
            <h4 class="section-subtitle">4) financial calculators</h4>
            <p>
              The last type of calculator we will discuss is the financial
              calculator. The financial calculator is an electronic device
              designed for solving financial problems and uses paper tape to
              print calculations for hard-copy record-keeping.
            </p>
            <p>
              This calculating machine can usually compute the present, future,
              rate of return and other critical financial concepts such as
              return on investment. Financial calculators are essential for
              anyone studying finance or working in the financial industry.
